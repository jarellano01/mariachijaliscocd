By applying combination of series of dance styles, Abbasi creates intense personal styles masterfully created by means of rules and omissions, acceptance and refusal, luring the viewer round and round in circles.
Kosar Abbasi was born in South-Iran and lived there till 19, due to the limitations against her self-taught career, the decision was to leave home and start the life’s adventure in India. As she left Iran and started her studies in Ayurveda field in India, Pune University, she started learning Latin dance and Indian ballroom dance as well. The Ayurveda study in university was helpful to understand the physique, soul and mind of human being more and led her not only to approach her activities in learning dance but also to share her knowledge by teaching those techniques. Kosar also had more than hundred performances during her seven-year stay in India and won the first prize in Latin dance festival in India for two years in 2008 and 2010. She was awarded an honorary Belly Dance Instructing certificate in 2009. Malaysia was the next destination in 2010 since she was feeling the lack of Iranian community around, and that was the other step of her success since she started to learn acting and performed in three different theatre performances with Iranian, Malaysian, and Japanese artist’s community and acting in Tamil movie productions in Malaysia.
Kosar Abbasi currently lives and works in USA. We are One is the Organization founded in 2014 by her right after achieving her dance instructing certificate with the vision of working on contemporary fusion dance as well as having dance students aside. Her works are on the one hand touchingly beautiful, on the other hand painfully attractive. Again and again, the artist leaves us orphaned with a mix of conflicting feelings and thoughts.`
